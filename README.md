ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp;Hi, my name is Dhruv Yadwadkar and I enjoy addressing modern problems through clean and efficient code. My MS in Computer Science @ Indiana University has helped me cultivate my interests in full-stack development and taught me to be more curious about the little things (and the big, really complex things too). Help me quench my technical curiosities by getting in touch with me for full-time software engineering opportunities at your company!
